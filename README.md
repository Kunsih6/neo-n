# Neo-n

This is my personal website and I built it with the following objectives:

- Get into web design, since until now I had built sites based on designs that were given to me and I was limited to making little decisions. Therefore, this is the first design 100% made by me.
- Play around and learn something new by adding new characteristics and modules that I had not used previously.
- Learn how to deploy to Firebase using GitHub actions.
- Have a public project that serves as an example of my work.

## About the project

I built the project thinking about using modules, features, or configurations that I have not used before. Such as:

- [nuxt-i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/)
- [pwa](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/)
- [tailwind-css](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/)
- [storyblok](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-nuxt)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.nuxtjs.org/)

I can probably improve a lot of things in this project, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
